# AboveVTT

AboveVTT is a project that integrates a VTT inside your DnDBeyond campaign. 

# Disclaimer

I (Daniele "cyruzzo" Martini) started AboveVTT as a hobby project. The initial target was just to have a shared maps and tokens,
but then things got out of hand. As this was just a way to "hack" inside DnDBeyond, I took every possible bad shortcut and ignored any best practice.
The goal was (and still is) to reach features quickly.

Considerations:
- Right now AboveVTT have people running games with it, so the most important rule for any PR is *we try our best to don't break things*
- Every PR *MUST* support basic compatibility with the previous versions of AboveVTT.
- Don't reformat the pieces you are not editing. It makes the PR hard to read, and you risk causing conflicts with other people work.
- Join the discord server and *talk with me* about what you are working on
- When you send me a pull request from one of your branches, don't add more features to that until I merge it (only bugfixes) 
- Try to keep different features in separate branches, so I can import them individually
- Be nice to other devs
